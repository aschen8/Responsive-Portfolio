    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Higher Brothers is a four-man rap group from Chengdu, China. The four members were roommates with a shared love for the foreign music style of hip hop and decided to form a rap group. Their name "Higher Brothers" is a play on words since it symbolizes their goals of raising awareness and love for hip hop in China, as well as it sounding similiar to the Chinese air conditioning company Haier. The Haier connection not only sound similar to the "Higher" in the group name but denotes a feeling of "cool" when spoken in a mainland Chinese context.</ul>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They blend unique linguistic skills with a modern day rap influence they can only obtain via illegal online methods by skirting the China Firewall to gain access to rap influences. One of their hits has as its subject, the insanely popular Chinese IM app WeChat. In the single, the first line that Masiwei sings references the Firewall and states "There's no Skype, no Facebook, no Twitter, no Instagram, we use WeChat!"
